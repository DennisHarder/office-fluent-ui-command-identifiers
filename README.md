Office Fluent UI Command Identifiers
===============

This GitHub repo contains all the Office Fluent UI command identifiers for applications that are currently under mainstream support:
 - <a href="Office 2013">Office 2013</a>
 - <a href="Office 2016/Perpetual-RTM">Office 2016 (RTM)</a>
 - <a href="Office 2016/Office365-Current-Channel">Office 365 (Current Channel)</a>
 - <a href="Office 2016/Office365-First-Release-for-Deferred-Channel">Office 365 (First Release for Deferred Channel)</a>
 - <a href="Office 2016/Office365-Deferred-Channel">Office 365 (Deferred Channel)</a>
 
<br/>
<br/>

Pro tip: If you only need to find control names, you can discover them within Office applications by hovering over commands in the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar) customization dialog and looking at the tooltip:
